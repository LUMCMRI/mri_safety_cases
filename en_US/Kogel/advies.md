# Airgun Pallet

## Advice

First we studied the chest X-rays in detail and concluded that the pellet shows a typical diabolo shape.

Then a thourough internet search of available airgun pellets was performed, both inside and outside of 
Europe for one never knows where people order their pellets of choice. All diabolo shaped pellets found were made of solid lead. 
Pellets that contained other material(s) than lead all had a different shape than the one present in the X-rays. 
For example pellets used in shooting galleries may consist of steel with a copper coating, but these have a round shape.

Below you find the advice we sent to our colleagues:

First the formal bit: we only share our advice, the decision whether the patient is allowed to 
participate and can be scanned safely lies with the radiologist or medical specialist that is responsible for the participants


What we conclude:

1. The bullet has the typical diabolo shape of an airgun pellet.
2. The material is unknown but we find it higly probable that the pellet (almost) fully consists of lead.
3. According to the candidate the pellet is in situ for over 20 years. We therefore expect it to be fully encapsulated.
4. The pellet is small, well encapsulated and (with high probability) non-ferromagnetic. We therefore expect no interaction
   with the main magnetic field, no translational or rotational forces and no forces due to the Lenz effect.
5. Because of the small size we do not expect any interaction with the RF waves, hence no (local) heating on 1.5T or 3T.
6. Because of the relatively superficial location we advice against the use of a local transmit coil that covers the chest.
7. The pellet may be located in the vicinity of intercostal vessels or nerves. However because of the anticipated encapsulation
   we do not expect this to be a problem.
8. The pellet will cause an imaging artefact that, depending on the type of imaging sequence, may extent up to 3cm from the pellet (rough estimate!). 
   

We would allow this subject to be scanned for scientific research on 1.5 or 3T as long as no local transmit coil is used for chest imaging.

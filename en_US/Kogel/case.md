# Airgun Pellet

## Introduction

You are confronted with a question from a colleague from another hospital.
It's about a patient (male, age 65) who wants to participate in a scientific study involving an MRI scan.
What raised concern is that this patient carries, already for 20 years, an airgun pallet in his chest as the result of a brotherly dispute.

The patient has no further possible contra indications. The doctors involved in the research project are keen on including this potential candidate.
Two scans are to be executed on a 1.5T scanner, one of the brain and one of the chest.

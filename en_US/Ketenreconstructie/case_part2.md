# Ossicular Chain Reconstruction

## Part 2

**Attention:** When searching the internet for information on the *Kurs prosthesis*, as it was written in the operation report, 
results can be quite disappointing. Unfortunately the name was misspelled, it should have read *Kurz prosthesis*.

A pro-active colleague calls the ENT department to check which Kurz prostheses they use. The ENT does not know for sure 
but consultation of the operation room department sheds light on the matter:
For a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) a Kurz Aerial Total Tuebingen Titanium is used and 
for a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) they apply a Kurz Clip Partial Prosthesis Titanium (Dresden type)

In the operation report it says *radical* ossicular chain reconstruction so we are dealing with a TORP here.

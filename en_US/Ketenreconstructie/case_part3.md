# Ossicular Chain Reconstruction

## Part 3

**Attention:** For the Aerial Total Tuebingen Titanium [MRISafety.com](http://www.mrisafety.com) shows the status *Safe* for 3T,
 however on their website Kurz states its MRI conditional. This is a clear example one should never stop when a first result is found!

**Question:** What is your advice?

<br>

**Hint:** Finding the correct MRI information on the manufaturer's website quite often requires a number of steps, here also:
* First go to Products > Otology > Tympanoplasty > Tuebingen Type Prostheses
* Check the presence of the item you're looking for. Yes, the TTP-TUEBINGEN Total Prosthesis is there
* Scroll down to *Oredering Information* and click TTP Tuebingen Type AERIAL Total Prosthesis. Here you find reference number 1004234 for the 3.0
* In the top right corner of the web page you find a link to *MRI Information*, click it
* From the MR-Information page you can download *MR_Information_en_Rev_07.pdf*, then open it
* In section 1.1 check the table for reference number 1004234 to make sure the information also refers to the item you are investigating
* Now don't fall for the trap that you stop when information seems complete. There is a referral to section 1.2 so please read it. Take the remark *Body coil only was used for testing as a worst-case assumption* into account and judge whether this may influence your advice

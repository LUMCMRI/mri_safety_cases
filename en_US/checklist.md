# An MRI safety question comes in. Then what?

#### Gather as much information as you can:

####1. Patient/Healthy volunteer
   * What is inside the subject: medical, non-medical?
   * How did it get there: accident, medical procedure, what kind of procedure, what purpose?
   * Where and when: year, what hospital, country?
1. More information: from hospital and internet
   * Medical operation report (manufacturer, model and type, size, procedure).
   * Pre- and post-operative imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI).
   * Manufacturer's website: 
     * which materials, shape and size, possible variants.
     * instructions for use and MRI safety information.
   * Check [MRISafety.com](http://mrisafety.com) for information and possible advice.
1. Scanner/Protocol
   * What type of examination is requested?
   * On which scanner should the examination be executed?
   * What scanner or protocol specific issues require special attention?
     * SAR
     * Switching gradient fields
     * Static magnetic field strength and spatial gradient
     * Noise or sound pressure level
     * Can the implant generate image artefacts and if so, are they relevant for the requested examination? 
1. Then formulate your advice
   * Depending on the information you found, your experience and whether it is a simple or complicated case this can be:
     * MRI safe, our subject can savely be scanned without special precautions
     * MRI conditional, our subject can safely be scanned under the following conditions. Then state all conditions that need to be fulfilled
     * MRI unsafe, our subject cannot be safely scanned. 
     * Insuffisiant information: request others to send the required info. This can be the manufacturer's product specialist or treating physician
     * The case exceeds your level of experience or knowledge: stay away from formulating an advice. Take the case to someone with more MRI safety experience and enjoy the learning

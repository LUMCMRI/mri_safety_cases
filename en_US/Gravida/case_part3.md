## Extra information
Upon inquiry, it turned out two interventions were performed. Below you find the reports

____
*Patient was referred to us for relief of the hydrothorax by means of  a shunt.*

**Procedures:**  
*Shunting Right  
Datum: dd-mm-yyyy  
AD: wwWdD  
Indication: Hydro/chylothorax* 
 
**Fetus xxxxxx, nnnnnnn**  
*Hydrops foetalis: yes  
Maternal Mirror Syndrome: no  
Medication fetus: atracurium, fentanyl  
Placenta location: high anterior  
Shunt type: Rodeck  
Start time: hh:mm  
Fetal side: right  
Total number of shunts intra-uterine: 1  
Complications: none  
Procedure succesful: partly  
End time: hh:mm  
Duration: xx minutes* 
 
**Conclusion:**  
*Prior cordocentesis for lysosomal enzyme determination and administration of fetal medication (R / Fentanyl / Atracurium)
Scheduled TA shunt placement bilaterally. After uncomplicated placement of the right shunt however, fetus turned into left lateral position that cannot be corrected. First wait for the effect of a unilateral shunt.  *


*******

**Report number 2:**  
*We saw the patient again on an outpatient basis on dd/mm (Ad ww + d).
As still no firm diagnosis has been found, we agreed to repeat the procedure on the left side.*  

**Shunting 2**  
*Date: dd-mm-jjjj  
AD: wwWdD  
Indication: Hydro/chylothorax*  

**Fetus xxxxxx, nnnnnnn**  
*Hydrops foetalis: yes  
Maternal Mirror Syndrome: no  
Placenta location: high anterior  
Shunt type: Rodeck  
Start time: hh:mm  
Fetal side: left  
Total number of shunts intra-uterine: 1  
Complications: none  
Procedure succesful: yes  
End time: hh:mm  
Duration: mm minutes*  
**Conclusion:**  
*Contralateral TA shunt placement (left) due to insufficient refurbishment after unilateral right shunt and still lack of a hard cause for the hydrothorax. * 


** Question: ** Search the internet for information about the applied shunts.
Can mother and child be scanned safely and if so, what special measures, if any, must be taken?

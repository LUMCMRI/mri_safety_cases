# Gravida with a surprise

## Information from the manufacturer.

You have probably found information at various places on the ** Rocket ** Medical MRI safety website, but it is not straight forward to say whether it is safe to scan.<br>
Please take note of what the Product Description says about the materials applied and how to deal with MRI-safety.

<br>

Via *Products / Delivery Suite - Labour Ward / KCHâ„¢ Fetal Bladder, Pleural Catheters & Rocket CVS Needles/ R57405 Rocket KCH Fetal Bladder Catheter * you'll find 
under *Learn More* the product description that tells you the catheter is 'MRI UNSPECIFIED'. ![](Rocket_cath_info_1_2020.png) 



**Attention:** The designation * MR UNSPECIFIED * only helps in the sense that we now know we are not dealing with the internationally accepted classification
 ** MR-safe, MR-conditional ** and ** MR-unsafe **.

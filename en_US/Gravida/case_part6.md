**Hint:**
Via *Products / Delivery Suite - Labour Ward / KCHâ„¢ Fetal Bladder, Pleural Catheters & Rocket CVS Needles/ R57405 Rocket KCH Fetal Bladder Catheter * you'll find 
under *Learn More* the product description that tells you the catheter is 'MRI UNSPECIFIED'. ![](Rocket_cath_info_1_2020.png)

<br>

**Attention:** 
The designation * MR UNSPECIFIED * only helps in the sense that we are not dealing with the internationally accepted classification
 ** MR-safe, MR-conditional ** and ** MR-unsafe **.

<br>
<br>

Please take note of what the Product Description says about the materials applied and MRI-safety.
**Question:** what is your advice?

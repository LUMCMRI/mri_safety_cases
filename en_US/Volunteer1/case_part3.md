# Healthy Volunteer

## Part 3

Hm Allthough the number of MRI examinations performed worldwide by far outnumbers the number of reports on 
tattoo-related adverse effects sometimes Tattoos proove treacherous. 



The medical specialist / radiologist is responsible for the patient's well being and for the decision whether scanning is allowed or not.
As an mri-safety expert you want to provide her/him with complete and up-to-date information and should be aware of the considerations and dilemma's 
the person responsible is confronted with. 
You may use the case presented here to test yourself on weighing the pros and cons, balancing the risc on adverse effects against the justification 
of performing an MRI scan. You may find a different outcome when considering the case for a healthy volunteer or for a patient that might benefit from a medical diagnosis.



General information and a discussion on tattoos can be found [here](http://www.mrisafety.com/SafetyInformation_view.php?editid1=228).

Below you find some publications on tattoos or the inks applied. This list is by no means intended as a scientific overview but more to 
give you an idea of the (lack of) clarity on the matter.

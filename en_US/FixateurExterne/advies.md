# External Fixator 

## Advice

* Scan on 3.0T using the Transmit-Receive head coil 
* **All** scans are to be acquired with this coil. Warning: this includes the Survey/scout scan.
* Gradient settings should be reduced as far as reasonably achievable.
* Padding is to be applied to prevent contact between fixator and 
    * the table or magnet bore, 
    * bare skin
* Instruct the patient about possible local warming and use of the nurse call button if this may occur.

**Question:** When the patient arrives at the MRI department he is sedated and rarely aware of his surroundings.
Does this make any difference?

# External Fixator 


## Introduction

For treatment of complex wrist fractures sometimes an *external fixator* is used.
On the right you see an example of such a device, made by the
 [Orthofix](http://www.orthofix.com) company. ![](fixateur_wrist.png)
 
 
**Medical Request:** Patient is a 55 year old male who fell from a ladder about 5 weeks ago, injuring his head and wrist. 
For follow up they now need an MRI of the brain including FLAIR, DWI and a susceptibility wheighted sequence.

**Extra information:** below you find the operation reports and post-operative images of the wrist X-ray.

Operation Report.  External Ventricular Drainage for Intraventricular Hemorrhage

GENERAL
Pre-operative diagnosis:
IVH with prog hydrocephalus
Therapy:
1-Bifrontal drain placement frontally
2-Stitching eyelid laceration


OPERATION REPORT
General anesthesia. Head in neutral position. Shaving L/R in prep of trephination and marking of incisions.
Shaving, 

General anesthesia. Head in neutral position. Bilateral shaving for frontal trephination and marking incisions. 
Shave, iodine, cover. Placement of incisions and bore holes, durotomy bilateral. Then bilateral in 1x puncture of lateral ventricle. 
Normal-slightly increased pressure, with production of drain on the right being heavily bloody. Tunneling drains and fixation on the skin.
Layerd wound closure after connecting drains to the collection system. Then suture laceration at the eyelid with Ethilon 5/0. Zero blood loss

Operation Report.  Fore arm, External Fixator Ulna and/or Radius

GENERAL
Pre-operative diagnosis:
Grade 1 complicated left intra-articular distal radius fracture
Post-operative diagnosis:
The same, but also in any case complete traumatic rupture tendon flexor carpi ulnaris left
Therapy:
External fixator over distal radius


OPERATION REPORT
Patient under general anesthesia in the supine position. Two ventricle drains have already been placed by neuro-surgeon. 
Briefing. Kefzol had already been given. Chlorhexidine, after which sterile covering left forearm. There is a transverse cut 
approximately 1 cm volar side at the level of the distal ulna. Tendon tissue sticks out here. When we take this out of 
the wound, it turns out to be the flexor tendon of dig 4 and 5, it is completely ruptured. Telephone consultation 
with the plastic surgeon. With the current status of the patient there is no indication to volar exploration for evaluation
of further tendon and / or nerve injury.
Under fluoroscopy, positioning for external fixator is determined. Incision over medioradiary side of distal part MC 2. Blunt to bone.
Drilling, after which second drill hole is determined with a drill sleeve. Two pins of the Orthofix fixator are placed bicortically.
Similarly, on the distal radius, just cranial to the muscle belly EPL. Orthofix fixator is placed. Closed reposition by means of traction, 
whereby a good stance is obtained in two directions. Tightening of fixator. Check again with fluoro, still good status. 
Incisions are approximated with Ethilon, as is the volar lesion. Fat gauze at the location of pin holes, followed by bandage. Debriefing. 
Blood loss: zero. The patient goes to the ICU postoperatively. In two days, a plastic surgeon will visit for further treatment of tendon injuries.

CONCLUSION
Grade 1 complicated left intra-articular distal radius fracture with traumatic tendon rupture of flexor dig 4 and 5 discovered peroperatively.

**Question:** Find out whether this patient can be safely scanned and if applicable, under what conditions.

# Stent 2

## Advice

<br>
#### On the stent
If all went well you found that these stents can be safely scanned under the following conditions:

* Static magnetic field of 1.5 or 3 Tesla.
* Spatial gradient field of 25 T/m (= 2500 Gauss/cm) or less.
* Maximum whole-body-averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2.0 W/kg (normal operating mode) for each duration of a sequence.

This makes the advice for the stent pretty easy:

* Scanning is allowed on 1.5T and 3.0T.
* Maximum SAR is 2 W/kg.

**Remark:** The radiology department that provided this case uses Philips 1.5 or 3T scanners of different generations. 
For all scanners the spatial gradient is lower than 25 T/m and therefore not stated in the restrictions that should be applied.

####On the hip prosthesis
As far as hip prostheses go: when recently placed they are, in general, not contra-indicated for MRI. For orientation one may visit [MRISafety.com](http://www.mrisafety.com), 
search The List for *hip* and sort on *status*. Also, one may find the safety info *Orthopedic Implants, Materials, and Devices* of interest, including the papers it refers to.




From the patient status there were no indications the hip prosthesis concerned an out of the ordinary situation. 
We therefore decided that the presence of the hip prosthesis required additional restrictions

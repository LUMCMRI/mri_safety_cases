Neurovascular clips can be used in the treatment of aneurysms
in intracranial arteries. Examples of what such a clip may look like 
you can find on this [site](http://www.nvca.be/en/treatments/surgery_aneurysm)

## The case

A patient presents himself at the reception desk without a
completed MRI-Safety questionnair. As requested by the MRI tech
he completes the questionnair in the changing cabinet.
No contra indications are presented but he makes the remark 
that he once was "operated on the head" in your hospital.

<br>

The requested MRI examination is a standard brain scan on a 3T scanner.

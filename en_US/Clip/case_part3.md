You probably found a couple of documents about Sugita clips. At least, there
appear to be two types of material these clips are made of:

* Sugita clips made of Elgiloy (an alloy)
* Sugita clips made of titanium 

There's also a list of type numbers of Sugita clips that are safe which also
includes a statement about the materials used

 Are there differences between documents?
